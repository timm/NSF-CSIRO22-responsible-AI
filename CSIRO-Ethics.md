## Title: Building Responsible Foundations for Reliable and Safe Deep Neural Networks

## Abstract:

Deep learning models are widely used in a wide range of industries and businesses. Reliable, safe and secure AI systems (e.g., using deep neural networks) are not an option but a priority in many critical domains to ensure business and consumer confidence. Prior work has shown that these AI systems suffer from robustness and responsible issues, for example, incorrect image recognition, biased prediction against underrepresented groups, and lacking user privacy protection. This project aims to mitigate and repair these robustness issues and quantitatively certify the robustness property of AI models. Our Australia-US research team will investigate and develop responsible AI tools and techniques including adaptive data augmentation (by supporting less-but-high-quality adversarial data), robustness-preserving model reduction (by optimizing models to reduce high-cost training), and symbolic verification techniques (by providing quantitative robustness guarantee). Significant benefits are expected to include greatly improved reliability and safety of critical AI infrastructures.


## Alignment with CSIRO missions:

- Example 1 Reliable plastic waste identification and transformation: 

AI-based recognition models trained with imperfect data (e.g., mislabeled or imbalanced data in the Australian Marine Debris Database) for rubbish identification and classification can cause incorrect image recognition results. The variance and imprecision of model prediction can result in unrecognized or improper assessments of rubbish (e.g., misclassification of plastics), which in turn affects or misleads the later waste management strategies and intervention methods.

- Example 2: Trusted agrifood supply chain: 

Robust and reliable AI models will help precisely verify the quality, safety, and 'green' credentials of Australian agrifood during critical event tracking in food supply chains. Responsible AI models can help measure the quality of food from the farming stage all the way to the delivery stage. The certified AI models can be used to conduct optimized scheduling, and shipping and understand consumer patterns based on a massive amount of data, in order to achieve efficient warehouse and inventory management, and allow digital-execution tracking (e.g., on blockchains) hence improving customer services and sustainability of the supply chains for Australia’s quality and trusted food.

- Example 3: Precise AI model for low carbon future: 

Deep learning models have become increasingly important for renewable electricity prediction and scheduling for Australian households to reduce carbon emissions.  On-demand and stable usages of clean and renewable energy are critically important, however, resilient scheduling highly depends on reliable prediction by precise and robust AI models. Balancing between renewable energy (e.g., produced by solar and wind turbines) and fossil fuels can
